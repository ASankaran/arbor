// Route is a struct that defines a route for a microservice
//
// Name: Name of the route.
//
// Method: The type of request (GET, POST, DELETE, etc.).
//
// Pattern: The exposed url pattern for clients to hit, allows for url encoded variables to be specified with {VARIABLE}.
//
// HandlerFunc: The function to handle the request, this basicically should just be the proxy call, but it allows you to specify more specific things.
